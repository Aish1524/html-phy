        <p class="content">Q.Why does red color deviate the most in case of grating?<br>

            A.This is so because in case of grating sin θ=n λ/(e+d) i.e angle of diffraction is proportional to the wavelength and the wavelength of red is maximum.
            <br><br>Q.What is diffraction grating?<br>

            A.It is an optically flat glass plate on which large number of equidistant parallel lines are ruled by a fine diamond pen.
            <br><br>Q.What is grating element?<br>

            A.It is the distance between the centers of any two successive ruled lines or transparent stripes.
            <br><br>
            Q.Define dispersion of light.<br>

A.The process of splitting of white light into it’s constituent colors is called dispersion of light.
<br><br>
Q.What is the full form of laser?<br> A.The term LASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
<br><br>
Q.What is order of diffraction?<br> A.They are the repeated diffraction patterns obtained on either side of the central maxima.
<br><br>
Q.What is zeroth order? <br> A.The central maxima formed when light incident normally on grating
